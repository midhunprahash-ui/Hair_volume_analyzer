## Hair Volume Analyzer

# Hair Volume Analyzer is an AI-powered tool that segments and analyzes hair volume from images. It uses instance segmentation to isolate hair and eyebrows, computes key facial distances (like the Euclidean distance between the lower hair edge and upper eyebrow edge), and extracts meaningful insights about hair density and volume.
